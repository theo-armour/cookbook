_Frozen sound_

## Concept

### Mission 
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* Translate numeric sound data in ASCII format in to 3D animations viewable in a browser
  
### Vision 
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

<!--
## Features
-->


## Road Map

* Make the data available in compressed binary files

## Issues /Bugs

* Sample data is the first 3MB of the original 900+ MB data file (not uploaded to GitHub )
* Sample file contains errors due to improper saving

* The data is not currently being read and displayed properly.


## Project Links

All of the scripts here are [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ).
Scripts are hosted on GitHub and are viewable as web pages, as described in the 'Read Me' files and as source code.

The three ways of looking at or using the scripts:

1. [Live Demo]( http://theo-armour.github.io/cookbook/sonichele/latest/index.html )  
2. [Read Me]( http://theo-armour.github.io/cookbook/sonichele/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >   
3. [Source Code]( https://github.com/theo-armour/cookbook/tree/gh-pages/sonichele/ "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>  

### System Requirements

In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i3 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The apps here are currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
